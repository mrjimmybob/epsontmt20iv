# TASKS — road from "works for this client" to a complete driver

The driver currently **works end to end**: Chrome → CUPS queue → filter → backend →
printer, correct width, correct cut. What follows is what separates it from a
*complete* driver. Nothing here is required to keep the current client running.

## How to use this file
Pick the **lowest-numbered open task**, read its section, implement it, run its
"Verify" step, then tick it in the table. One task per change/commit. Each section is
self-contained: it says *why*, *where in the code*, *what to do*, and *how to prove it
worked*. Read `FACTS.md` first — it holds the printer ground truth and stops you
re-testing things already proven.

## Priority key
| Pri | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| **1** | Very important — a real bug, or something that will hurt in daily shop use |
| **2** | Important — expected driver behaviour / deployment quality |
| **3** | Not that important — robustness, maintainability, tidiness |
| **4** | Optional — productisation, only if this ever ships beyond this client |

## Already done — do not redo
- `print-scaling-default=none` is set in `install.sh`. **Never remove it** — without it
  pdftopdf shrinks every ticket to ~25%. See FACTS.md.
- The cut is emitted **once per page** in `process_page()`. CUPS makes copies by
  duplicating the page (`cupsManualCopies: True`), so per-page = per-copy cut (T02). Do
  NOT add an `argv[4]` copies loop in the filter — that double-counts (the 3×3=9 bug).
- PPD page height is 300 mm (`850.39 pt`), which keeps Chrome's print preview sane.
- **T01 (paper/cover/error → CUPS state)** — implemented, unit-tested, verified on the
  unit. Blocked state → `CUPS_BACKEND_RETRY` (auto-recovers on paper reload).
- **T02 (copies)** — CUPS duplicates pages; filter cuts per page; no filter-side loop.
- **T03 (width guard)** — dormant `WARN` on width != 576.
- **T06 (1-bit rendering)** — resolved; jobs now render `1 bpp, colorspace=3`.
- **T07 (chunk limit)** — measured: single request ≥3600 dots (~450mm) works;
  `CHUNK_ROWS` = 1024 (was 256). Whole receipt fits one POST.
- **T08 (debug geometry)** — DEBUG line logs `res=...dpi` and `height=...mm`.
- **T12 (tests)** — raster core factored into `src/raster.c`/`.h`; `make test` runs
  `test_status` + `test_raster` (pure, no CUPS/curl). Keep them green.
- **T15 (repo hygiene)** — binaries untracked, `.gitattributes eol=lf`, `.claude/` ignored.

# Priority 1

## T01 — PAPER-STATUS · Report printer state to CUPS  ✅ DONE
**Implemented and verified against the real printer.** `src/status.c` / `src/status.h`
decode the ASB bitmask; `epos_backend.c` emits CUPS `STATE:` reasons and picks the exit
code; `tests/test_status.c` (run via `make test`) covers the decode logic. Confirmed A/B
on the unit by direct `curl`:

| Paper | `success` | `code` | `status` (dec / hex) |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| in    | true  | *(empty)*        | 251658262 / `0x0F000016` (print-success bit set, no errors) |
| out   | false | `EPTR_REC_EMPTY` | 252444700 / `0x0F0C001C` (**paper-end `0x00080000` set**, print-success cleared, offline `0x08` set) |

So the `0x00080000` mask is correct → paper-out raises `STATE: +media-empty-error` and
CUPS shows "out of paper". The blocked-state exit code is **`CUPS_BACKEND_RETRY`** (was
STOP): the job waits with the reason visible and prints itself when paper is reloaded, no
manual `cupsenable`. Cover-open (`0x20`) and cutter/mechanical bits are **not yet
physically confirmed** — see the T01-followup note below if you want them bulletproof.

**Why (original).** A POS printer runs out of paper constantly. Before this, a paper-out
looked like a generic failure: staff saw nothing useful and the job could be lost. The
ePOS reply carries `status="N"`, an Epson ASB (Automatic Status Back) bitmask.

**Where.** `src/epos_backend.c` — the result mapping block near the end of `main()`
(currently: success → `CUPS_BACKEND_OK`, `EX_TIMEOUT` → `RETRY`, else `FAILED`). The
response body is already captured in `response`.

**What to do.**
1. Parse the `status="..."` attribute out of the response body (plain `strstr` +
   `strtoul` is fine) into a `uint32_t`.
2. Decode the ASB bits. Per Epson's ePOS-Print SDK these are the documented values —
   **confirm empirically** (see Verify) before relying on any single one:

   | Bit | Meaning |
   |-----|---------|
   | `0x00000001` | no response from mechanism |
   | `0x00000002` | print success |
   | `0x00000004` | drawer kick state |
   | `0x00000008` | offline |
   | `0x00000020` | cover open |
   | `0x00000040` | paper being fed by button |
   | `0x00000100` | waiting for online recovery |
   | `0x00000400` | mechanical error |
   | `0x00000800` | autocutter error |
   | `0x00002000` | unrecoverable error |
   | `0x00004000` | auto-recoverable error |
   | `0x00020000` | receipt paper **near end** |
   | `0x00080000` | receipt paper **end** |

   Anchor: a healthy print returns `251658262` = `0x0F000016` (print-success + drawer
   state + fixed high bits; no error bits). A wedged mechanism returns `1`.
3. Emit CUPS state reasons by writing to **stderr** — CUPS reads these:
   ```
   STATE: +media-empty-error      /* paper end   */
   STATE: -media-empty-error      /* cleared     */
   STATE: +media-low-warning      /* near end    */
   STATE: +cover-open-error       /* cover open  */
   STATE: +other-error            /* cutter / mechanical / unrecoverable */
   ```
   Always emit the matching `-reason` when the condition is absent, or the queue will
   stay stuck showing a stale error.
4. Choose exit codes deliberately: paper-out should **not** discard the ticket. Use
   `CUPS_BACKEND_HOLD` (or `RETRY`) so the job survives until paper is reloaded.

**Verify.** Induce each condition on the real printer and log the raw `status` value
first (`fprintf(stderr, "DEBUG: epos: status=0x%08X\n", st);`): (a) remove the paper
roll, (b) open the cover, (c) print normally. Confirm the decoded bits match the table,
that `lpstat -p TMT20IV-ttp` and the GNOME printer UI show "Out of paper", and that the
held job prints when paper is restored.

**References.** FACTS.md → "ePOS endpoint" (response shape). `cups/backend.h` for exit
codes.

**T01-followup (optional robustness, Pri 3).** The printer also returns an explicit
`code="EPTR_REC_EMPTY"` on failure — a documented Epson error identifier, cleaner than
bit-guessing. Add a `code`-based path in `status.c` to complement the bitmask:
`EPTR_REC_EMPTY`→media-empty, `EPTR_COVER_OPEN`→cover-open,
`EPTR_AUTOMATICAL`/`EPTR_MECHANICAL`/`EPTR_UNRECOVERABLE`→other-error. Keep the bitmask
for the *near-end warning* (`0x00020000`), which stays `success="true"` and so carries no
`code`. Benefit: cover-open and cutter errors work without having to physically confirm
each bit (only paper-end `0x80000` has been confirmed on the unit so far).

---

## T02 — COPIES · Honour the requested copy count  ✅ DONE
**Verified on the unit: `lp -n 3` → 3 receipts, 3 cuts.** The fix was *not* what the
"What to do" below assumed. `*cupsManualCopies: True` means **CUPS already makes the
copies by duplicating the page**, so the filter receives N pages — it must NOT multiply.
The final shape: PPD stays `cupsManualCopies: True`; the filter emits each page it is
given with a **per-page cut** (`process_page`), so each duplicated copy is separately
cut; there is **no `argv[4]` loop** (an earlier attempt multiplied on top of CUPS's
duplication → 3×3 = 9 receipts; then flipping the PPD to `False` disabled duplication →
1 receipt; `True` + no loop = correct). Note this reverted the earlier once-per-job cut
(FACTS.md updated) — safe because a receipt is a single-page job.

**Why (original).** `lp -n 3` used to print one ticket: the filter never produced copies
and the PPD's copy semantics weren't wired to anything.

**Where.** `src/rastertotmt20iv.c` `main()` (argument handling + the emit at the end);
`ppd/tmt20iv.ppd` line with `*cupsManualCopies`.

**What to do.** Either:
- **(a) Implement it (preferred).** Parse `argv[4]` as an unsigned count (default 1,
  clamp to something sane like 1–20). Emit the whole per-job body **including its
  `<feed>`/`<cut>`** once per copy, so each ticket is separately cut. Note the cut now
  lives in `main()` — repeat the body+cut together, not just the images.
- **(b) Delegate it.** Set `*cupsManualCopies: False` and let CUPS run the chain per
  copy. Simpler, but N× the rasterising and N× the HTTPS POSTs.

**Verify.** `lp -n 3 -d TMT20IV-ttp sample_receipt_80mm.pdf` → exactly three identical
tickets, three clean cuts, one job in `lpstat`.

---

## T03 — WIDTH-GUARD · Fail loudly on unexpected raster width  ✅ DONE
**Implemented** — `process_page()` now has an `else if (width != PRINTER_WIDTH_DOTS)`
branch logging a loud `WARN:` (received vs expected 576, plus the likely cause:
page-size / 203 dpi / `print-scaling=none`). It still prints (narrow beats nothing) but
can no longer hide. It's a **dormant guard** — silent in normal operation (every real
job is 576 wide), so there's nothing to see unless something regresses. To exercise it
deliberately, print a PDF whose page is < 80 mm wide and check the log for `!= expected`.

**Why (original).** The width check only caught *too-wide* rasters; a *narrower* one was
emitted as-is and the printer centred a small image — exactly how the "prints too small"
bug hid for a day.

**Where.** `src/rastertotmt20iv.c` `process_page()`, the existing
`if (width > PRINTER_WIDTH_DOTS)` block (~line 179).

**What to do.** Add an `else if (width != PRINTER_WIDTH_DOTS)` branch that logs a loud
`WARN:` (or `ERROR:` — your call whether a wrong-size ticket should fail rather than
print small) including both the received width and the expected 576, plus a hint that
the usual cause is page-size/resolution/`print-scaling` misconfiguration.

**Verify.** Temporarily create a queue whose PPD says 150 dpi, print, and confirm the
warning appears in `/var/log/cups/error_log`. Restore afterwards.

---

# Priority 2

## T04 — CUT-AND-DRAWER · Cut mode and cash-drawer options
**Why.** The two features every POS deployment asks for next. Both are already
supported by the ePOS protocol; we simply never expose them.

**Where.** `ppd/tmt20iv.ppd` (new `*OpenUI` groups); `src/rastertotmt20iv.c` where the
`<feed>`/`<cut>` is emitted in `main()`; options arrive in `argv[5]` and can be parsed
with `cupsParseOptions()`.

**What to do.** Add PPD options and honour them:
- `CutMode`: `Feed` (current, `<cut type="feed"/>`), `NoCut`, and partial/full variants
  the firmware accepts.
- `DrawerKick`: `None` (default), `Before`, `After` — emit
  `<pulse drawer="1" time="pulse_100"/>` accordingly.
- `FeedLines`: how many `<feed line="N"/>` before the cut (currently hard-coded 3).

**Verify.** `lp -o CutMode=NoCut`, `lp -o DrawerKick=After` etc. produce the expected
physical behaviour; defaults must reproduce today's output exactly.

---

## T05 — PAPER-WIDTH · Support 58 mm as well as 80 mm
**Why.** The TM-T20IV takes both roll widths; `PRINTER_WIDTH_DOTS 576` is a
compile-time constant, so a 58 mm roll would misprint.

**Where.** `src/rastertotmt20iv.c` (`PRINTER_WIDTH_DOTS`); `ppd/tmt20iv.ppd`
(page sizes + a media/width option).

**What to do.** Add a second page size (58 mm ≈ `164.41 pt` wide, 48 mm/384-dot
printable — confirm on the unit) and derive the expected width from the raster header /
selected media instead of the constant. Keep 80 mm the default. Note this interacts
with T03 — the guard must compare against the *selected* width, not a fixed 576.

**Verify.** Load a 58 mm roll, select the 58 mm size, print the sample: full width, no
clipping, no warning.

---

## T06 — RASTER-HEADER · Fix the PPD sample-header error  ✅ DONE
**Resolved.** The filter now receives the true 1-bit raster the PPD asks for:
`rastertotmt20iv: page 576x1439 (emit width 576), 1 bpp, colorspace=3, bytes/line=72`
(was `8 bpp, colorspace=18, bytes/line=576`), and `grep -c "sample header"
/var/log/cups/error_log` returns 0 for current jobs. Output verified visually identical
("receipt looks fine"). This was the first time the filter's 1-bit path ran in
production — confirmed good, no inversion. 8× less data per job. It cleared up alongside
the page-geometry work (the job now renders at its own media size); if the
`sample header` error ever returns, the notes below are the bisection plan.

**Why (original).** Every job used to log `E ppdFilterLoadPPD: Unable to generate CUPS
Raster sample header.`, so the PPD's `ColorModel` (1-bit, `cupsColorSpace 3`) was ignored
and Ghostscript rendered 8-bit sGray (`colorspace=18`) — 576 bytes/line where 72 would
do, for byte-identical output.

**Where.** `ppd/tmt20iv.ppd`.

**What to do.** Note `cupstestppd -v` reports **no errors** — the PPD is conformant, so
this is something `cupsRasterInterpretPPD()` specifically chokes on. Bisect: copy the
PPD and remove suspects one at a time, reinstalling and printing after each —
`*VariablePaperSize`/`*CustomPageSize`/`*ParamCustomPageSize` (note `WidthOffset` and
`HeightOffset` declare zero-width ranges `0 0`, and `Min/MaxMediaWidth` are both
`226.77` while `ParamCustomPageSize Width` allows `220 230` — inconsistent), the very
large `*MaxMediaHeight: 14400`, then `*ColorModel`. Also confirm the installed PPD has
no CRLF line endings (see FACTS.md).

**Verify.** The `E ... sample header` line disappears from `/var/log/cups/error_log`,
and the filter's own DEBUG line reports `1 bpp, colorspace=3` instead of
`8 bpp, colorspace=18`. Output must be visually identical.

---

## T07 — CHUNK-LIMIT · Measure the real max `<image>` height  ✅ DONE
**Measured.** A throwaway script POSTed all-white (no-ink) images of decreasing height
until the first success. **3600 dots @ 576 wide (~450 mm, ~338 KB request) prints fine**
on the first try — bigger than any real ticket, and the whole receipt goes in one POST.
The true max is higher (not probed further, to save paper). `CHUNK_ROWS` moved from the
guessed **256 → 1024** (`src/raster.h`) — a comfortable margin below 3600 that cuts the
chunk count ~4×. FACTS.md records the ceiling. `moved to raster.h`, not
`rastertotmt20iv.c` (see T12). Note: this is also the effective **max receipt length per
POST** (~≥450 mm); a taller receipt would need multi-POST splitting (not implemented, not
needed).

**Why (original).** `CHUNK_ROWS 256` was a guess. Too large and long receipts could fail
on some firmware; unnecessarily small wastes XML overhead.

**Where.** `src/rastertotmt20iv.c` `#define CHUNK_ROWS`.

**What to do.** Write a throwaway script that POSTs a single `<image>` of increasing
height (256, 512, 1024, 2048, …) directly to the ePOS endpoint until it stops returning
`success="true"`, then set `CHUNK_ROWS` to a comfortable margin below the limit.
Document the measured ceiling in FACTS.md.

**Verify.** A very long receipt (200+ lines) prints as one continuous ticket with one
cut, and the chosen chunk size is recorded in FACTS.md.

---

## T08 — DEBUG-GEOMETRY · Log resolution and page height  ✅ DONE
The filter's DEBUG line now also prints `res=%ux%udpi` and `height=%.1fmm`, e.g.
`page 576x1439 (emit width 576), 1 bpp, colorspace=3, bytes/line=72, res=203x203dpi,
height=180.1mm`. Resolution is the number that would have caught the tiny-print bug at a
glance; height flags long-receipt/pagination cases. Compile-checked; visible at
`LogLevel=debug`.

**Why (original).** When the tiny-print bug struck, the one number that would have
identified it instantly — the render resolution — wasn't logged. Cheap insurance.

**Where.** `src/rastertotmt20iv.c`, the existing `DEBUG: rastertotmt20iv: page ...`
`fprintf` in `process_page()`.

**What to do.** Add `header->HWResolution[0]`/`[1]` and the page height in points/mm to
that line.

**Verify.** Print anything; the DEBUG line shows `203x203 dpi`.

---

# Priority 3

## T09 — DISCOVERY · Real backend device discovery
**Why.** `src/epos_backend.c` `argc == 1` prints one hard-coded line, so the printer
never appears in CUPS "Add Printer" — you must hand-type `epos://<ip>`. A complete
backend enumerates devices.

**What to do.** On the no-arguments path, discover TM printers (mDNS/DNS-SD, or an SNMP
sweep, or Epson's discovery protocol) and print one line per printer:
`network epos://<ip> "Epson TM-T20IV" "<friendly name>" "<device-id>"`. Keep it fast
and bounded (CUPS gives backends a short timeout).

**Verify.** `/usr/lib/cups/backend/epos` with no args lists the real printer; it shows
up in the CUPS web UI's Add Printer list.

---

## T10 — DITHER · Halftoning for photos and logos
**Why.** `pack_row()` hard-thresholds 8-bit grey at 128. Perfect for text, barcodes and
QR; blotchy for photographs or gradient logos.

**Where.** `src/rastertotmt20iv.c` `pack_row()` (the `cupsBitsPerPixel == 8` branch).

**What to do.** Add an ordered (Bayer) or Floyd–Steinberg dither, selectable via a PPD
option (`Halftone: Threshold|Dither`), default **Threshold** so current output is
unchanged. Floyd–Steinberg needs an error-diffusion row buffer — mind that `pack_row()`
is currently stateless per row.

**Verify.** Print a page with a photo: visibly smoother in Dither mode; a text/QR ticket
in Threshold mode is byte-identical to today.

---

## T11 — TUNABLES · Move `#define`s into PPD options
**Why.** `CHUNK_ROWS`, `TRIM_PAD_ROWS`, `LEAD_PAD_ROWS`, `INVERT_BITS`, the HTTP/ePOS
timeouts and the feed count are compile-time constants. Changing any of them means a
rebuild and redeploy.

**What to do.** Promote the ones that a site might reasonably tune into PPD options
(parsed from `argv[5]` via `cupsParseOptions()`), keeping current values as defaults.

**Verify.** `lp -o TrimPad=48` changes the trailing whitespace with no rebuild.

---

## T12 — TESTS · Golden-file tests for the raster→XML core  ✅ DONE
**Done.** To make the core testable without CUPS, the raster→XML logic was factored out
of `rastertotmt20iv.c` into a CUPS-free module **`src/raster.c` / `src/raster.h`**
(`base64_append`, `pack_row` — now takes `bits_per_pixel`/`src_bytes_per_line` instead of
a `cups_page_header2_t`, `emit_strip`, `render_page_body`). The filter is now just CUPS
glue that reads rows and calls `render_page_body`. `tests/test_raster.c` (run by
`make test`) covers: base64 vectors incl. padding, `pack_row` 8-bit threshold / 1-bit
copy / unsupported-depth, and `render_page_body` for all-blank, an exact single-row
end-to-end golden, single-ink-row trim (28 rows), both-edges (no trim), and a 2500-row
page chunked 1024+1024+452. 20 assertions, all green; builds and runs on Windows and the
Mint alike (no CUPS/curl). Note: the T03 width-guard lives in `process_page` (CUPS side),
so it's exercised by the on-Mint print + compile, not this pure suite.

**Why (original).** The bit-packing, base64, trimming and chunking are pure functions —
easy to test, and exactly the kind of code where the `tmbridge` bugs hid until we ran it.

**What to do.** Add a `tests/` target that feeds known CUPS raster files (or synthetic
buffers) through the packing/trim/chunk path and diffs the emitted XML against checked-in
golden files. Include: all-blank page, single ink row, content at both edges, a page
needing exactly N chunks, and a width ≠ 576 case (pairs with T03).

**Verify.** `make test` passes; deliberately breaking a bit-shift makes it fail.

---

## T13 — PAGE-SIZES · Offer several named page lengths
**Why.** One named size (300 mm) means Chrome shows no paper-size choice. Handy lengths
would let an operator match a long ticket and get a tighter preview.

**What to do.** Add `80x150mm` (`425.20 pt`), `80x200mm` (`566.93 pt`), `80x300mm`
(`850.39 pt`, default), `80x500mm` (`1417.32 pt`). Because the cut is per-job (see
"Already done"), a receipt overflowing the chosen page paginates harmlessly.

**Verify.** Chrome's *Más ajustes* shows a paper-size selector; each choice previews and
prints correctly.

---

## T14 — STREAMING · Stream strips instead of buffering the page
**Why.** `process_page()` allocates the whole page bitmap plus the whole base64 body
before emitting. Fine at 300 mm; wasteful, and it scales badly with page length.

**What to do.** Emit each `<image>` strip as it is completed. Note this conflicts with
the current blank-trim strategy, which needs to see the whole page to find the last ink
row — a streaming version needs a lookahead window or a two-pass read of a temp file.
Only worth doing if page sizes grow.

**Verify.** Memory use flat across page lengths; output byte-identical.

---

## T15 — REPO-HYGIENE · Stop tracking build artifacts  ✅ DONE
The compiled `epos` and `rastertotmt20iv` binaries are no longer tracked
(`git rm --cached` + ignored by exact path), a `.gitattributes` with `* text=auto
eol=lf` is in place (this repo round-trips through Windows and CRLF broke `install.sh`
once — FACTS.md), and `.claude/` is ignored. `git status` stays clean after a build.

**Why (original).** The compiled binaries were committed to the public repo;
`.gitignore` covered `*.o`/`*.exe` but not extensionless ELF binaries, and there was no
`.claude/` entry.

**What to do.** Add `/epos`, `/rastertotmt20iv`, `.claude/` to `.gitignore`;
`git rm --cached` the two binaries. Add a `.gitattributes` with `* text=auto eol=lf` —
this repo round-trips through Windows and CRLF already broke `install.sh` once (FACTS.md).

**Verify.** `git status` clean after a build; a fresh clone on Linux runs
`./install.sh` without the CRLF failure.

---

# Priority 4 — only if this ships beyond this client

## T16 — PACKAGING
Build a `.deb` (filter, backend, PPD, postinst running `lpadmin`), add a `.drv`/PPD
database entry so the model appears in the CUPS Make/Model list instead of needing a
PPD file path, add a man page and a version string (currently none anywhere).

## T17 — TLS-TRUST
TLS verification is unconditionally off (correct today — the cert's SAN carries the
factory IP, see FACTS.md). Add an option to supply a CA/pinned cert and enable
verification, for sites that re-issue the printer's certificate.

## T18 — I18N
The PPD's option and choice names are English-only. Add translations (at minimum
`es`) so the print dialog reads correctly for the Spanish site.

## T19 — DRIVERLESS
Expose the printer as an IPP Everywhere / driverless device (e.g. via
`ippeveprinter`) so phones, macOS and other clients can print with no queue setup at
all, instead of every host adding the shared CUPS queue.
